WHY does EVERY FAMILY
have that ONE RECIPE
that NOBODY can ever REPLICATE?
Your mom makes IT LOOK EASY
like SHE'S CASTING SPELLS
while you're over here
following the recipe WORD FOR WORD
and it comes out LIKE CARDBOARD.

The WEIRDEST part
is everyone TREATS IT LIKE A NATIONAL TREASURE.
Like, you can SMELL IT FROM THREE ROOMS AWAY
and suddenly
GRANDMA'S ROLLING HER EYES
because you dared
to STIR IT TOO MUCH.

Then there's the SECRET INGREDIENT
that nobody will EVER TELL YOU.
Sometimes it's LOVE, sometimes it's RAGE, 
and sometimes it's literally
A PINCH OF MAGIC DUST
that only exists
in your family's KITCHEN DIMENSION.

And when you finally try to make it
at your own house,
it HATES YOU.
It refuses to taste right,
refuses to behave,
and YOU end up ordering PIZZA instead.
Because some things
are just meant to STAY MYSTERIOUS.
