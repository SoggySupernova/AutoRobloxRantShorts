**Why** does **every family**
have that **one recipe**
that **nobody** can ever **replicate?**
Your mom makes **it look easy**
like **she's casting spells**
while you're over here
following the recipe **word for word**
and it comes out **like cardboard.**

The **weirdest** part
is everyone **treats it like a national treasure.**
Like, you can **smell it from three rooms away**
and suddenly
**grandma's rolling her eyes**
because you dared
to **stir it too much.**

Then there's the **secret ingredient**
that nobody will **ever tell you.**
Sometimes it's **love**, sometimes it's **rage**, 
and sometimes it's literally
**a pinch of magic dust**
that only exists
in your family's **kitchen dimension.**

And when you finally try to make it
at your own house,
it **hates you.**
It refuses to taste right,
refuses to behave,
and **you** end up ordering **pizza** instead.
Because some things
are just meant to **stay mysterious.**
