## Generating a Video

1. Replace "Why do we all have that one friend who..." with your topic
2. Click Generate All
3. Check the three textboxes and the the three numbers in the top right. All three numbers should match. (todo: add "Subscribe." to first text so this is actually true)
4. If the numbers don't match, use one or both of the other two Regenerate buttons until the second and third numbers match. (The first number isn't really important) You can also edit the text by hand if you prefer.
5. Click "Start TTS Server." Wait until it says "Running on local URL" and then click "Generate TTS." todo: do this automatically
6. Click "View File." Listen to the generated audio file. f5-tts struggles with hyphens and exclamation points. If this is an issue, edit the second textbox and regenerate the TTS with the previous two buttons.
7. Click Align Subtitles. todo: combine add subtitles and render video and add "view final video" button
8. Click Render Video.
9. Check the video "FINALVIDEO.mp4"
10. If everything looks good, click Clean Up.

## Tips

* Don't use the script generator. It's terrible. Until I improve it, I recommend generating the script with a better model like ChatGPT and using the Regenerate buttons to generate the other scripts.
